        <H1>Ping pong game made in Python</H1>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>I created a ping pong game in python using tools i have learnt from my digital tech class and websites that show tutorials online. It works as intended because i have fixed all he bugs i could.</p>

        <h3>End Users</h3>

        <p>The people who would enjoy this game are probably people who enjoy retro arcade games since thew  game i made is very retro and old. Or maybe people trying to find new simple 2 player games to play in their free time might like it. </p>
